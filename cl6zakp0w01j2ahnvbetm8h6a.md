## My SuperPower.

# 1.0 Introduction
> **Dear Diary -     8/7/2020**    
> 
> Thursday morning, it's bright and early but a little bit chilly. There's so much to look forward to today. We are having a career fair in school today.


I captured this in my diary on the morning of a highly anticipated school career fair back in high school. 


Huh! It's funny how I never got to finish journaling about the events that happened after I was done with the day. I never got back to that page again, ever! I still don't have the exact reason as to why I didn't but for sure, the memories of that day are still vivid.




My physics teacher, yeah I was a STEM major!😁 - logic and math made more sense to me than a lot of reading and memorizing a lot of social/historical content.  He used to say that the most important day of a person's life is ***the day they were born and the day they realize why they were born.*** This was followed by a soar laugh and a tiny smile from him.


His statements at the time baffled me. I kept pounding on what he meant, because yes!- his high and mighty physicist ego wouldn't let him expound more on the statement. 😒


> Back to the career fair.

Other than the free food, snacks, and unique free swag😁😊 everything was basically the same. However, there's one thing that stood out for me - the guest speaker that was invited - Catherine Kamau, a senior back-end engineer working for a financial firm at the time.👨‍💻💡



## 2.0 The Story.
Catherine stood firm and calm on the podium. She told us a little story about her career journey. 

She said when she was younger, her mind was all over the place trying to settle for a career choice.
At around the age of 10, she said, she loved superheroes - she still does. Her favorite was spiderman. Catherine told us that she saw herself a lot in spider man. Spiderman helped people using his super spidey powers which for her was mind-blowing.

She added smiling jokingly that
> Spidy - the name she christened spiderman😊😁, must be having a lot of fun with this.

Her love for superheroes channeled her passion to want a career that allowed her to help people but also have fun at it. 

Growing up, she added that she transitioned from wanting to become a doctor👩‍⚕️, to a lawyer ⚖️and finally a software engineer👨‍💻. 
She told us that software engineering for her was her ***spidy moment***. She spoke with so much passion and agility about how much she enjoyed every bit of her work. 





## 2.1 My light bulb moment💡

As she continued, I only glared with marvel. She glowed as she spoke about her career and the cool things she does. I was so lost in her words that I couldn't help but push an unconscious smile toward her while she spoke.



> Coding is my superpower.  Writing software that goes to solve a particular problem for another person makes me feel like I am a spider-woman- a superhero.  

> The process itself is challenging - it involves a lot of mental strength however, having to ship code to production and see the end-users apply the software solution to a problem they have is more than satisfying.

>  I love my job. We get to solve crucial financial problems, It's hectic, but I really have a lot of fun at it and I wouldn't want it any other way.


These were her last words before leaving the stage with a loud applause. At that single moment, I thought to myself this was what my Physics teacher repeatedly said - realizing the Why.


When I looked at Catherine I felt inspired.  I wanted to be in her shoes. I wanted to be in her place.   I looked at her and saw a lot of love and genuine appreciation for her work. It gave her a sense of meaning and purpose😊.

I wanted the same. Every bit of it😊💡.  



## 2.2 My journey so far.
### My Education

 I am pursuing a BS in CS.👨‍💻😊 Uni has given me the right basics/ foundation in programming. However, in my honest opinion, that ain't enough. I had to go out of my way to get a solid understanding of programming.

### Some Courses I have taken in school:

- Object-oriented programming with Java.

- Data structures and Algorithms. - This was hopefully taught, I am redoing it on my own.

-  Calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math.

 ###  My go-to programming resources.

- Web Development course by Angela Yu. This was a winner for me.

- Python programming course by Anglea Yu.

- A lot of youtube channels. But to be specific, I really frequent freecodecamp channel mostly.

- Lastly, blogs on areas I am learning.


## 2.3 My takeaways.
There is so much I have learned since I started development and building projects.

My major lessons:
   
- **Never stop learning.**

I think coding and development in general has to be the most dynamic field out there to be in. There is so much to learn and every day a new tech/ library/ framework keeps popping up.   
Just keep on learning and building. I believe that's the only you master the trade.

- **It's a journey and it's relative.**

We all have different learning curves and that's ok. Trust and have faith in your own learning path. It's ok to go fast and it's still ok, to go slow.

- **Choose a specific development path.**

Coding is exciting. There is so much to learn and quite a good chunk of career paths. It's important to decide on the get-go which path best fits you. It makes you're learning a bit more effective and ideal - since you have an end goal.

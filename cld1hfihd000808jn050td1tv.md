# Common API Security Testing Misconceptions

API security concerns have significantly increased with the rapid adoption of APIs in cloud, web, and mobile applications. Research conducted by 451 Research on the [state of API security in 2022](https://nonamesecurity.com/api-security-trends-report), noted that 41% of companies had an API security incident in the last year. With the continued growth of API integrations in different applications and shared services, it's becoming increasingly important for companies to rethink and reimagine the security of their APIs.

Unfortunately, many misconceptions about API security can lead to detrimental security risks if not addressed properly. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common misconceptions about API security.

## What is API Security Testing?

API (Application Programming Interface) security testing is the process of evaluating an application’s APIs to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. It helps organizations ensure that their applications are secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations. The goal of API security testing is to detect any flaws or misconfigurations in the system which could be exploited by malicious actors, such as hackers or malware.

## Common misconceptions

Despite its importance, there are several misconceptions surrounding API security testing that can lead organizations astray when it comes to ensuring their applications are secure:

* **APIs don't need to be tested because they haven’t had any issues yet.**
    

This misconception suggests that if no problems have been encountered so far then there isn’t a need for further testing. However, this doesn’t take into account the fact that new threats may emerge over time that could exploit existing vulnerabilities in an organization's APIs. Therefore, regular API security tests should be conducted regularly to ensure the application remains secure against potential threats.

* **APIs don’t need frequent updates because they aren't changing.**
    

Even if an organization's APIs aren't being actively changed, they still need to be updated regularly in order to protect against emerging threats and known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors at any time without prior warning signs being visible beforehand. Therefore, organizations should ensure their APIs remain up-to-date through frequent patching and updating cycles as part of their overall API security strategy.

* **API security testing is not necessary because the application or system has already undergone security testing.**
    

While it is true that security testing should be performed on the entire application or system, API security testing serves a specific purpose. API security testing focuses on testing the security of the API itself, including its authentication and authorization mechanisms, input validation, and other security-related aspects. This is important because APIs are often the entry point for attackers, and any vulnerabilities in the API can be easily exploited.

* **APIs are Secure By Default.**
    

This is simply not true. APIs, just like any other form of web-based application, requires a comprehensive security strategy to ensure that they are adequately protected. It is important to understand that APIs are vulnerable to a variety of cyber-attacks including data breaches, DDoS attacks, and other malicious activity. As such, it is essential to implement a comprehensive security strategy that includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security measures to prevent attacks from malicious actors.

* **You only need basic authentication for your APIs.**
    

Authentication is one of the most important components of securing an application's APIs as it ensures that only authorized users can access them. While basic authentication may suffice for simple applications, more complex ones require more robust solutions such as multi-factor authentication or token-based authentication systems which provide greater protection against unauthorized access attempts by malicious actors.

* **You don't need third-party tools for your API tests.**
    

Manual methods may be appropriate for small-scale projects, however, using third-party tools can save time and resources in larger-scale operations where multiple tests need to be run simultaneously. Additionally, these tools often offer better insights into potential vulnerabilities, helping organizations quickly identify areas that require further attention before serious damage can occur.

* **You don't need automated tests since you already have manual ones.**
    

Automated tests help speed up processes while also providing better coverage than manual tests alone, allowing organizations to quickly spot any deviations from expected behavior which could indicate a vulnerability present within their system. Without automated tests, it would take significantly longer periods of time --often resulting in costly delays --for teams to uncover these issues before damage occurs.

## Wrapping Up

Organizations must recognize some common misconceptions about API security testing if they wish to keep their applications safe from malicious actors seeking out vulnerable points within their system architecture. By understanding what these misconceptions are --and taking steps towards addressing them-- businesses can ensure their apps remain protected even under the ever-increasing cyber threats landscape.

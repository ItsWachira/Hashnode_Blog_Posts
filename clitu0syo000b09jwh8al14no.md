# Introduction

In this day and age, social media platforms have become an integral part of the lives of university students; and Kenyatta University students are no exception. These platforms offer avenues for self-expression, communication, and social connection. Consequently, students utilize these platforms to create virtual networks, share experiences, and engage in communities they identify with, influencing their interactions both within and beyond the university setting. This creates a feeling of connection with others, albeit, virtual.

The advent of social media has evidently led to the rise of figures known as celebrities. Simply put, celebrities are people who are famous for a certain reason. In our case, we are talking about celebrities whose fame came about as a result of the content they post on social media platforms. The influence of these celebrities on KU university students has risen significantly over the years. These celebrities, both local and international leverage social media as a powerful tool to engage with their fans, shape trends as well as promote their products.

As Kenyatta University students navigate the ever-changing landscape of social media and celebrity culture, it becomes vital to understand the effects of these phenomena on their mental and overall well-being. This research proposal aims to investigate the effects of social media and celebrity culture on the use case of university students, with a specific focus on the students enrolled at Kenyatta University.

By seeking to understand the intersection of social media and celebrity culture in the Kenyatta University context, we look to shed light on the psychological effects on students’ behavior, experiences, and attitudes. We need to know why the students are so engrossed in these platforms to make sane conclusions on the effect of these platforms on said students.

The research aims to contribute its findings and provide insights that can inform interventions, policies, and support mechanisms to promote the well-being and success of Kenyatta University students.

## Background

Social media platforms have gotten a significant rise in popularity and usage over the past decade, becoming a key part of people's daily lives. Social media gained momentum in Kenya in 2008 when people began to actively use Facebook. Prior to Facebook, popular platforms at the time were MySpace and Yahoo. At the same time, celebrity culture has evolved and changed in the digital age, with celebrities now wielding significant influence and commanding a vast online following. The convergence of social media and celebrity culture has resulted in a powerful force that shapes individuals' attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions.

Social media usage has greatly increased over time, ranging from personal use to business and marketing of products, to movements and sharing ideas. At the forefront, media personalities have used social media to ensure they reach their followers through multiple social media platforms. The rise in popularity of Kenyans on Twitter, the use of WhatsApp which has become a part of campus everyday life, and the popularity of Instagram among other social media platforms has cemented social media presence among the students.

The average age of students who are admitted to Kenyatta University is around 18 years, so most of the students at KU are around 18 to 24 years. According to recent research, global consumers aged 20 to 29 are the biggest users of social media, putting kenyatta university students among the majority of users of these social media platforms. There is a strong social media presence at the university, with events like Mr and Miss KUSA, Mr and Mrs KU, and culture weeks among others, which promote a sort of 'campus celebs' and also get trending on KU social media spaces, reaching a wider online audience.

Similarly, the advent of celeb culture has been rising simultaneously with social media. In the past, popular personalities were harder to reach, only available at live events and the occasional television appearance. With social media, celebrities are now a single tap away, from the ability to put as much content online as they want to. This has accelerated the culture of celebrity worship, created new so-called celebrities out of gaining popularity on social media platforms, and put them on an easily accessible pedestal of sorts.

## Problem Statement

The widespread adoption of social media platforms among Kenyatta University students, coupled with the influence of celebrity culture, poses several challenges that impact their well-being and academic success. Firstly, excessive usage of social media platforms may lead to detrimental effects on students' mental health. The constant exposure to idealized and curated images on social media can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and increased anxiety among students. Moreover, the continuous comparison with the seemingly perfect lives portrayed by celebrities on social media can exacerbate these negative emotions and create unrealistic expectations for students.

Secondly, the growing influence of celebrity culture on Kenyatta University students raises concerns about the prioritization of popularity and superficial values over genuine personal growth and academic achievement. The glorification of celebrities and their lifestyles may lead to students idolizing them, emulating their behavior, and striving for fame rather than focusing on their educational pursuits. This shift in priorities can potentially hinder students' academic performance, diminish their motivation to excel and compromise their future career prospects.

Additionally, the interplay between social media and celebrity culture may contribute to the erosion of critical thinking skills and the spread of misinformation among Kenyatta University students. The viral nature of social media platforms and the endorsement of celebrities can amplify the dissemination of unverified information and false narratives. This can mislead students, hinder their ability to discern credible sources of information and compromise their academic integrity.

By addressing these issues, interventions can be developed to promote the holistic well-being and academic success of Kenyatta University students in the digital age.
